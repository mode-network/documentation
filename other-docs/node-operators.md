\
**VERIFY**

Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

* `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
* Check that the Fjord time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
* Check that the Fjord time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
