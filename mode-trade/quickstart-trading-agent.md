# Quick Start: Mode Trade Agents

## What are Mode Trade Agents?

Mode Trade Agents are automated trading assistants that help you trade more consistently. They handle execution, risk management, and trade monitoring so you don’t have to make decisions in the heat of the moment.

Instead of constantly watching the market or second-guessing your plan, an agent executes the rules you set. This helps you:

- Avoid emotional trading
- Manage entries and exits
- Remain consistent over time

> **Note:** Agents do **not** guarantee profit - they are tools to support your trading.

## How to Launch Your First Agent

### 1. Create a Sub-Account

- One agent per sub-account.
- Fund it before creating your agent.

### 2. Choose a Strategy

- **Breakout:** Fast, short-term trades, trading a breakout from a range.
- **Trend Following:** Ride longer moves while trends persist and closes once they finish.

### 3. Configure Risk

- Set how much of your sub-account to risk.
- Choose leverage carefully.
- **Remember:**
  - **Maximum position size:** $5000
  - **Minimum order size:** $10 (balance × leverage must be at least $10)

### 4. Launch Agent

- A secure API key is created (trading only, no withdrawals).
- Your agent begins trading automatically.

## Monitoring Your Agent

- Dashboard shows open positions and status.
- Expand an agent card to see trade logs and details.
- Pause and edit settings anytime.

## Important Notes

- PnL will vary between users due to slippage and market conditions.
- Do **not** manually close or resize trades. It may disrupt your agent.
- Start small, learn how it works, and scale up gradually.

> By creating an agent, you accept the risks of trading and agree to the full Disclaimer & Risk Notice.
