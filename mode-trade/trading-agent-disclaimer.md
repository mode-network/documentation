# Disclaimer and Risk Notice

## Trading Risk

By using **Mode AI Trading Agents**, you acknowledge that trading digital assets involves a high degree of risk, including the potential loss of your entire investment. The performance of automated strategies may vary and there is **no guarantee of profit**. Past performance is **not indicative of future results**.

## Independent Execution

Mode AI Trading Agents execute trades automatically on your behalf. Execution outcomes may differ from other users due to variations in order timing, slippage, liquidity, and market conditions. As a result, your realised prices, position entries and exits, and overall profit and loss (PnL) may not match those of others running the same strategy.

## Sub-Account Requirements

- Each agent must operate in its own sub-account.
- Only one agent may run per sub-account.
- You must create and fund a sub-account before launching an agent.

## Position and Order Size Limits

- The **maximum position size per agent** is limited to **$5,000 equivalent**.
- The **minimum order size** on Mode Trade is **$10**.  
  _It is your responsibility to ensure that your sub-account balance, when multiplied by the leverage you have selected, is sufficient to meet this minimum requirement._

## API Keys and Security

When you create an agent, a new API key is generated for your Mode Trade sub-account. This key is stored securely and has restricted permissions:

- It permits trading actions only.
- It does **not** allow withdrawals of funds.

## Agent Management

Agents are designed to manage positions automatically in accordance with their configured strategy. For best results and to avoid conflicts in execution, **we strongly recommend that you do not manually close or alter the size of positions opened by an agent**. Manual intervention may cause unexpected outcomes, including but not limited to premature liquidation or inconsistent PnL reporting.

## User Responsibility

By creating an agent, you accept **full responsibility for the risks associated with automated trading, including potential losses**. You acknowledge that Mode Trade does **not guarantee specific outcomes and will not be liable for financial losses or damages** resulting from the use of automated agents under any circumstances.
