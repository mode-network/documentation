# Verifying your smart contract

Verifying a smart contract involves confirming that the contract's code on the blockchain matches the source code provided by the developer. This process allows all other users to see the source code in clear text that was deployed on chain. \
\
For example, in our SFS contract you can see it's verified and you can see the code:\
\
[https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x8680CEaBcb9b56913c519c069Add6Bc3494B7020?tab=contract](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x8680CEaBcb9b56913c519c069Add6Bc3494B7020?tab=contract)\
\
**Purpose and Importance:**

1. **Transparency:** Verification allows users and stakeholders to review the contract's code, ensuring that it performs the intended functions without hidden or malicious operations.
2. **Trust:** In the blockchain ecosystem, trust is paramount. By verifying a contract, developers assure users that the deployed contract is genuine and operates as advertised.
3. **Security:** Verification enables the identification and auditing of the contract's code by the community or security experts, which can help in spotting vulnerabilities or bugs.
4. **Interoperability:** Verified contracts can be more easily integrated with other applications and services, as their functionality and interfaces are clear and validated.
