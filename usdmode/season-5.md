## Introduction

Mode’s governance experiment is about to become a lot more fun and engaging, with the introduction of Streamers and Agents. Building on Season 4 which saw experiments in bribe markets, Season 5 will focus on incentivising education and engagement with AI apps and agents building across the ecosystem.

## What's new in Season 5?

#### 1. Streamers and Agents added to veMODE&#x20;

Protocols can now rely on Hidden Hand’s established bribe infrastructure, removing confusion around eligibility or claim processes. This translates to frictionless user experiences.

#### 2. Transparency

All eligible participants for guages must provide transparency in how they distribute OP incentives in order to remain gauge-eligible, helping the community stay informed and confident about the deployment of rewards.

#### 3.  Tokenomics and Sustainability

Season 5 will use OP as the primary incentive mechanism. Apps, Agents and Streamers that secure votes get a slice of OP each epoch. This model not only rewards active participants but also ensures the broader Mode ecosystem remains vibrant.&#x20;

#### 4.  Agentic Staking and Voting

Thanks to Mode’s AI Terminal, MODE holders can now use AI to stake their Mode to veMODE.&#x20;

As the AI Terminal comes out of Beta expect to see the barriers for entry to be reduced significantly for all users.\
