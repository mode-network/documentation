# 🌱 Staking

Staking is enabled for $MODE and the MODE/USDC Balancer Pool Token giving additional benefits for the current Season 2.\
\
By staking your $MODE or MODE/USDC Balancer Pool Token you'll get points boosters and OP rewards. Please note that unstaking has a cooldown period of 7 days.&#x20;

## OP rewards

Once a week 20,000 OP will be distributed to everyone that staked Mode. Your share depends on the amount you staked, and the amount of blocks that passed. [**Read More**](https://mode.mirror.xyz/PZiQ32QH8S\_HcyK\_NI93KYdlE\_koufq92dS7TKPgoIY)**.**\
\
**OP rewards have been live since Thursday May 16th 2024.**

**Key things to know about OP rewards:**

* At 4pm UTC on Thursdays we take the weekly snapshot
* On Fridays at 11am UTC the weekly claim will be released
* You need to claim your OP tokens for the week before the next claim is published.&#x20;
* **OP rewards will be distributed on the Optimism chain.**

## Criteria for the points booster

1. Users need to stake enough $MODE to equal either 25% or 50% of their entire portfolio valued in USD. All assets from the wallet on Mode Mainnet are taken into account.\
   \
   Example:\
   If you are holding 100 USDC you will have to stake 25$ worth of $MODE or 50$ worth of $MODE in order to get the booster.\
   &#x20;
2. If the ratio drops (due to price action or asset reallocation), there is a day of grace period for users to stake more $MODE to get their ratio balance back. \
   &#x20;
3. When users are eligible for a points boost, they earn either 1.25x or 1.5x for all points they earn on any asset or position during that time. **This is a global multiplier on all other activities.**\
   \
   You earn **1.25x** if staked $MODE is 25% or more of your portfolio.\
   You earn **1.50x** if staked $MODE is 50% or more of your portfolio.\
   \
   If your staked $MODE falls below 25% of your total portfolio, then you will no longer be eligible for the booster until your $MODE staking goes back over 25%. You have a 24 hour grace period before you lose the booster. Same thing happens with 50% and the 1.50x booster.\

4. Locked tokens in liquidity pools are not counted in the protocols for the booster yet. However, these LP positions do count for points and incentives. \

5. Eligibility for the booster is calculated daily.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is an unstaking waiting period (cooldown) of 7 days. Please be mindful of this when staking your tokens.

## Stake & unstake

* The user can stake as many tokens as they have in their wallet, and unstake as many tokens as they have staked.&#x20;
* Tokens will be available to withdraw 7 days after unstaking. Unstaking more tokens resets the cooldown period. The cooldown period resets if you unstake again.\
  \
  Example:\
  \
  You have 20 staked tokens. You unstake 10 tokens on day 1. The withdrawal period starts counting.\
  \
  After waiting for 3 days, you decide to unstake the remaining 10 tokens. Now the withdrawal period resets.\
  \
  You now have to wait 7 days to withdraw the total 20 $MODE.\

* During the unstaking cooldown period, you will not be able to manage or move these tokens. Tokens can be withdrawn and be managed after the cooldown period.
