# 🔓 Mode L2 Security Model

## Mode Security Model

Mode is an OP Stack L2 and a key part of Optimism Superchain. Mode runs the OP Stack mainnet configuration in partnership with Optimism.&#x20;

In return for ongoing technical and product support from Optimism, Mode contributes sequencer fees, and reseach and innovation to the OP Collective.

### Mainnet Multisig <a href="#op-mainnet-multisig" id="op-mainnet-multisig"></a>

The security of Mode L2 is currently dependent on a multisig managed jointly by the Mode Security Council, the [Optimism Security Council(opens in a new tab)](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) and the Optimism Foundation.&#x20;

This multisig can be used to upgrade core Mode L2 smart contracts **without upgrade delays** to allow for quick responses to potential security concerns. All upgrades to the system must be approved by both component multisigs and either can veto an upgrade.

### Bugs and Unknowns <a href="#bugs-and-unknowns" id="bugs-and-unknowns"></a>

Please also keep in mind that just like any other system, **the Optimism codebase may contain unknown bugs** that could lead to the loss of some or all of the ETH or tokens held within the system. The OP Stack has been audited [on many occasions(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/technical-documents/security-reviews), but **audits are not a stamp of approval** and **a completed audit does not mean that the audited codebase is free of bugs.**

It's important to understand that using Mode inherently exposes you to the risk of bugs within the  codebase, and that you use Mode Mainnet at your own risk.
