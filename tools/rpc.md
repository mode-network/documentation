# üñ•Ô∏è RPC

{% hint style="success" %}
If your project needs better performance you can try running your own node. Check all the information here: [node-operators.md](../other-docs/node-operators.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Public RPC (Archival node)

Our public RPC is a full archive node and should be enough for most use cases:\\

RPC Endpoint: [https://mainnet.mode.network/](https://mainnet.mode.network/)

RPC & websocket: [https://app.conduit.xyz/published/view/mode-mainnet-0](https://app.conduit.xyz/published/view/mode-mainnet-0)

Testnet RPC: [https://sepolia.mode.network/](https://sepolia.mode.network/)

## Tenderly

Tenderly Node is a fast and reliable production node that enables access to over 12 blockchain networks via RPC. It allows you to send transactions, deploy smart contracts, query blockchain data or other operations without having to run your own node or manage infrastructure.

## Blast API - Decentralized Web3 Infra - (Archival node)

Solving Web3 reliability and performance issues by efficiently employing the resources of hundreds of third party node providers combined with a state-of-the-art decentralized blockchain API platform and an improved user experience.\

## 1RPC

Automata now supports Mode mainnet via their 1RPC, this introduces an extra layer of security by protecting some metadata from being shared to interact with RPCs in a more private way. You can learn more about 1RPC [here](https://docs.1rpc.io/overview/about-1rpc).

## dRPC

dRPC is decentralised RPC network that enhances security, reliability, and cost-efficiency for Web3 companies of all sizes. We are building the most reliable and cost-efficient Data providing solution via a decentralized platform. Learn more about dRPC [here](https://drpc.org/chainlist/mode).

RPC Endpoint: [https://mode.drpc.org](https://mode.drpc.org)

## thirdweb

thirdweb consistently ranks amongst the highest performing RPC endpoints. Begin transacting and reading on the MODE network without running your own node architecture as well as seeing real time RPC status and endpoint [here](https://thirdweb.com/mode?utm_source=modedocs\&utm_medium=docs).
