# üóÇÔ∏è Data Indexers

## [Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/)

Goldsky offers two core self-serve products that can be used independently or in conjunction to power your data stack. Subgraphs that have flexible indexing with typescript, with support for webhooks and more. Then also Mirror which lets you get live blockchain data directly into your database or message queues with a single yaml config.\

## [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)

The Graph is an indexing protocol that provides an easy way to query blockchain data through APIs known as subgraphs. Anyone can create or query subgraphs, making the data available to the entire ecosystem. With GraphQL, you can specify the exact fields you want to query.

The Graph‚Äôs infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dApp to become truly decentralized.

Follow this [quick-start guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.

## [Indexing Co](https://www.indexing.co)

Indexing Co offers just-in-time indexing, data engineering, and custom data infrastructure services. Any EVM or non-EVM chain can be indexed with the ability to integrate off-chain data. Our data pipelines are optimized for decoding, transformations and aggregations to ensure delivery and low-latency. Our indexer and data pipeline infrastructure is made for modular chain setups, multi-chain products, the explosion of L1/L2/L3 chains and AI. 

Publish a data flow using our [Console](https://console.indexing.co/) or [get in touch](https://www.indexing.co/get-in-touch) for custom data pipelines.

## [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/mode-testnet/)

Covalent is a blockchain data service that offers access to both current and historical on-chain information over a range of more than 100 blockchains, which includes Mode.

Covalent holds an archival version of every blockchain it supports. This encompasses details of every transaction, balance, log event, and digital asset from the start of that blockchain. You can retrieve Mode data through their [API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/mode-testnet/).

For further details, please refer to [https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/mode/](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/mode/)

## [SQD](https://sqd.dev/)

SQD unlocks next-gen functionality for dApps, AI agents, analytics and ZK Proofs/TEE through blazing-fast indexing.

SQD is a decentralized hyper-scalable data platform optimized for providing efficient, permissionless access to large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data, including event logs, transaction receipts, traces, and per-transaction state diffs. SQD offers a powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and processing pipelines, achieving an indexing speed of up to 150k blocks per second.

To get started, visit their [documentation](https://docs.sqd.dev/) or see their [EVM examples](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-examples) of what you can build with SQD.

## [Envio](https://envio.dev/)

Envio is a full-featured indexing solution and data provider on Mode that provides apps and developers with a seamless and efficient way to query and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data.

[HyperIndex](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/mode) let's you deploy a backend API for your application in minutes for any EVM. [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) is a purpose-built data node on Mode that let's you query data up to 1000x faster than standard JSON-RPC using various languages (Python, Typescript, Rust and Go). 

Learn how Envio is supporting apps on the OP Superchain, like [Aero-/Velodrome](https://github.com/enviodev/velodrome-indexer), [Bridgg](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/case-study-bridgg-op-superchain), [Sablier](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/case-study-sablier), and [Limitless](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/case-study-limitless-prediction-market).
